----------

Date: 25th January

Contents: theory of decision trees, k-nn, all error based learning algorithms, neural networks.

You should be able to:

* induce a decision tree and understand the information gain calculations
* apply and know the K-NN algorithm
* Determine weights when for a univariate, multivariate and logistic regression problem, compute error signals etc.
* Understand the theory taught for neural networks - we will not examine the recurrent neural network material
* The section on momentum, architecture selection, active learning will not be examined
