Practical
---------

1) See examples on how to create a decision tree classifier and a regression tree here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html
2) We usually split a dataset into training and testing. In Python here an example on how to do this https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html
3) Now create a decision tree classifier on this dataset. Induce the tree on training data and apply it to testing data
4) Now create a regression tree classifier on this dataset. Induce the tree on training data and apply it to testing data
